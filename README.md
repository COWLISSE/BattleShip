# BattleShip Online

## Introduction

> This is an online BattleShip game fully working in Java. Using JavaFX. Netty.io and Gson, we have developed a replica of the board game that we all played when we were younger. This project is a school project that we pushed way further than we had to do.

## Installation

> 
- To run BattleShip, you'll need two things, the client and the server.
- **First**, install the Client and the Server if you want to host your own server.
- **Second**, if you want to host your own server, launch the server first (Don't forget to change the IP Address in the Client to connect to your server)
- **Third**, Launch the client
- *Have fun !*
